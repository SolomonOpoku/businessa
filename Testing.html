                 The best class in West Africa Senior High School (from 2018 to 2020), every type of human trait
                 (funny, talkative, God-fearing, serious, into sports,
                 into comics and movies, complainers, organizers, copiers, studying hard, optimistic, etc.)
                 were all in one room, which made the class and school very GREAT for everyone in it even the teachers. In this class,
                  there is no sadness, no one man show, everything was done in groups and family form.
